TITLE: Group Call for Mechanical Design

NOTES:
	- Rotary Encoder Component Order Followup
		- Called Samtec Directly
		- Found that the encoder connector will not be shipping until March 31st from their facility in Costa Rica
		- Attempted to get the order shipment pushed up from the current specified date but they stated they were
		  working at capacity and would be unable to push the date up
	- Mechanical Design Call
		- GROUP MEMEBERS PRESENT: Antony Habib, Jarod Nekl
		- Discussed the overall state of the heel cup Design
		- Discussed potential solutions for the rail system on the device
		- Expressed concerns on the components order and in particular the rotary encoder connector
		- Determined that I will go to the BRB after the call to attempt to determine the status of the components order with all
		  the closures due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 (Corona Virus)
		- Work meeting scheduled after the WAM on 03/18
		- PCB will be reworked to include a Quadrature input connection for potentially using a different rotary encoder in the case
		  that the desired connector dosn't arrive in time for our demonstration
		- Also will include GPIO inputs for motor homing circuitry in the case that a failure occurs with the actuation

TITLE: Components order check in at the BRB

NOTES:
	- Came in to speak directly with Travis about the components order status after failed email attempts
	- Travis was not in so spoke with Russ instead
	- The current state of the components order is unknown since Russ doesn;t have access to the order system
	- Attempted to meet with the Building Manager Jeff Kaipust who is in charge of all orders for the BRB
		- Jeff was not in his office
		- An email was sent in order to determine the status and possible delays due to the campus closures
	- Contacted the team to get in touch with Dr. Knarr about checking component order status
	- Manager to locate some thin gauge wire that will likely work for the needs of the rotary encoder connector if we must
	  go with the crimp connestor option.
	- Currently the members of the BRB are on a caome in late leave early due to the Corona Virus
	- Able to complete the remaining functions for the motor controller that are not dependant on other device firmware
	- Pushed changes up to github
	- Aquired rotary encoder connector wire that will be thin enough for encoder development
	- Plan on developing new PCB design with motor control feedback and the GPIO buttons for simplified UI on device.
	- Will attempt to leave parts in the same position to allow the same stencil to be used for assembly
