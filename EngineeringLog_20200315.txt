TITLE: Motor Driver Development Continued

NOTES:
	- Plan to work on completing the variable speed control functions that were under development on 03/12-03/14
	- Identification of the proper control variable to manipulate is required for further advancement on the speed control
	- Explored this link which provided a method for dynamically changing the pulse width of the waveform produced by the timer:
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43483762/using-stm32-hal-timer-and-adjusting-the-duty-cycle-of-a-pwm-signal
	- Potential solution for dynamically adjusting the frequency of the PWM signal:
