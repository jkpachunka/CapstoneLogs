TITLE: Motor Driver Development Continued

NOTES:
	- Motor control development work time to complete the variable control portion of the motor driver software
	- Should be able to control the speed of the blinking LED that will simulate the pulses sent to the motor controller
	- Reviewed PLL's for clock multiplication
	- Determinges that the current board will not require an external crystal to function at the full
	  84 MHz operating frequency.
	- Able to get the standard PWM signal to work properly
	- Got the PWM signal advancing the motor properly
	- Able to adjust the PWM signal using the CubeMX configuration tool
	- Configured different step modes
	- Determined that the 4 - 800 - ON - OFF - OFF configuration to have the best speed to power
	  ratio for the use of the ASAP device
	- Able to increase the overall output frequency to 10 kHz at the highest step count setting
	- 5 kHz was found to be the optimal top speed for the ideal speed to power configuration of the
	  motor driver
